## 🌟 Overview

The AI Application Generator is a tool that automates the creation of Streamlit and Gradio applications using multiple AI models. This tool helps developers, data scientists, and software engineers to quickly prototype and generate code for various applications based on simple text descriptions.

## ✨ Features

- **🧠 Multiple AI Models**: Powered by Gemini Pro 2.0, CodeT5, and T0_3B
- **📋 Template Selection**: Choose from various templates for both Streamlit and Gradio
- **🌓 Light/Dark Mode**: Toggle between light and dark theme for comfortable coding
- **✅ Code Validation**: Automatically validate generated code syntax
- **🔍 Code Formatting**: Format generated code for readability
- **💾 Export Options**: Download generated code or copy to clipboard
- **🔄 Regeneration**: Easily regenerate code using different models
